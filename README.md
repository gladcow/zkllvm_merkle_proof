# zkllvm_merkle_proof
**zkllvm_input** contains files to build with zkllvm,  I've build it with https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-template. This build output is placed in **evm_placeholder_verification_input** to build it with https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification. 

I've added EVm proof verification to the evm-placeholder_verification fork as a pull request https://github.com/gladcow/evm-placeholder-verification/pull/1 to simplify changes overview. Test for proof verification is marked with my comment.
