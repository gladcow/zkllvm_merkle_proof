# zkllvm_merkle_proof
*zkllvm_input* contains files to build with zkllvm,  I've build it with https://github.com/NilFoundation/zkllvm-template. This build output is placed in *evm_placeholder_verification_input* to build it with https://github.com/NilFoundation/evm-placeholder-verification. This part is not completed yet, I need to form gate_arguments solidity scripts to complete.
